Turing language support for Atom
================================

This package adds support for [Turing](http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/doc/), a Pascal-like programming language developed in 1982 at the University of Toronto.
Named after English computer scientist [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), the language is widely used in Ontario high schools as an introduction to programming.
